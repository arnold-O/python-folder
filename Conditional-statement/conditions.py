# Normally statements in python execute one after the other but conditional statement helps with the flow control ,
# for them not to execute just one line after another but for each lin to execute due to a certain reason/criteria me


#operators used are either relational or logical


#relational
# < less than
# > greater thn
# <= less than or equal to
# >= greater than or equal to
# =! not equal to
# == equal to

#logical operators
# or = OR
# and = AND
# not = NOT

#the above are the relational and logical operators

# These operators resolve to boolean , that is true or false

# examples

b = 12
a =  5

if a<=b:
     print("a is less than b")
else:
     print("b is less than a")
